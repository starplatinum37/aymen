      <h1>About Us Page</h1>
      <p>
        the empire of Shurima was once a thriving civilization that spanned an
        entire continent. Forged in a bygone age by the mighty god-warriors of
        the Ascended Host, it united all the disparate peoples of the south, and
        enforced a lasting peace between them. Few dared to rebel. Those that
        did, like the accursed nation of Icathia, were crushed without mercy.
        However, after several thousand years of growth and prosperity, the
        failed Ascension of Shurima’s last emperor left the capital in ruins,
        and tales of the empire’s former glory became little more than myth.
        Now, most of the nomadic inhabitants of Shurima’s deserts eke out a
        meager existence from the unforgiving land. Some have built small
        outposts to defend the few oases, while others delve into long lost
        catacombs in search of the untold riches that must surely lay buried
        there. There are also those who live as mercenaries, taking coin for
        their service before disappearing back into the lawless wastelands.
        Still, a handful dare to dream of a return to the old ways. Indeed, more
        recently the tribes have been stirred by whispers from the heart of the
        desert—that their emperor Azir has returned, to lead them into a new,
        wondrous age.

            <p>“Blood and vengeance.”~ Renekton</p>
            <p>
              Renekton is a terrifying, rage-fueled Ascended being from the
              scorched deserts of Shurima. Once, he was his empire’s most
              esteemed warrior, leading the nation’s armies to countless
              victories. However, after the empire’s fall, Renekton was entombed
              beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he
              succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed
              with finding and killing his brother, Nasus, who he blames, in his
              madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.

            <p>“What was fallen will be great again.” ~ Nasus</p>
            <p>
              Nasus is an imposing, jackal-headed Ascended being from ancient
              Shurima, a heroic figure regarded as a demigod by the people of
              the desert. Fiercely intelligent, he was a guardian of knowledge
              and peerless strategist whose wisdom guided the ancient empire of
              Shurima to greatness for many centuries. After the fall of the
              empire, he went into self-imposed exile, becoming little more than
              a legend. Now that the ancient city of Shurima has risen once
              more, he has returned, determined to ensure it never falls again.

              “Shurima was once the glory of Runeterra. I will make it so

            </p>
            <p>
              Azir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud
              man who stood at the cusp of immortality. His hubris saw him
              betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but
              now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an Ascended being of
              immense power. With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir
              seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.
